# Lab 08 - Api Management

## Summary of Lab

This lab covers Azure API Management service.
It's experimental in several ways:

- it uses modules deployed as Ansible Collection
- modules follow new light-weight pattern - they have no dependencies on Python SDK (except of msrestazure), meaning no additional packages have to be installed on the top of Ansible
- Modules are aligned with Azure CLI, meaning that Ansible modules have almost exactly the same parameter structure and that results in very smooth transition between Azure CLI and Ansible.
- Exactly the same examples are included in Azure CLI command module help, in Ansible documentation and in this lab.
- All the examples are imported from Azure REST API specification directly (any necessary fixes are backpropagated)
